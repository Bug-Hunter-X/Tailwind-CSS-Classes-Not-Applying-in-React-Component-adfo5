# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying in React Component

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when using Tailwind CSS in React applications:  styles not applying correctly to components.

The `bug.js` file showcases a React component where Tailwind classes are not rendering as expected.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code and explains the solution.

## Problem

The initial implementation in `bug.js` uses Tailwind CSS classes that are not being properly interpreted or applied by the React component.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses the problem and explains why the original code failed. The solution usually involves ensuring the correct configuration and setup are in place, which might include double-checking the Tailwind CSS installation, configuration, and proper import statements within the React component.
